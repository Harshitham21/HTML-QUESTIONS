    <li><div><strong>Library Management System</strong></div>
I worked on a Library Management System project designed to simplify and automate library operations. The system helps in managing book details, student or user information, and records of issued and returned books. It reduces manual work and improves accuracy in maintaining library data. Through this project, I learned how to design basic system modules, handle structured data, and understand the flow of information in a real-world application. This project also improved my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.</li>
<li><div><strong>Drug Prediction Using Advanced Machine Learning</strong></div>
I completed a major project on Drug Prediction using advanced machine learning techniques, which focuses on predicting appropriate drugs based on patient or medical data. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and applying machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions. It helped me gain strong knowledge of machine learning concepts, model training, and performance evaluation. This project enhanced my understanding of how artificial intelligence can be applied in the healthcare sector to support better medical decision-making. It also improved my analytical skills and practical experience in working with real datasets.</li>
